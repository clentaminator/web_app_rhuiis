# RHUIIS - Rural Health Unit Immunization Information System

  The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and other mortality indices are vital indicators of a region's general health status. High infant mortality rates indicate unmet needs in cleanliness, medical care, nutrition, and education. Immunization is crucial for public health, preventing millions of deaths annually from diseases like measles, diphtheria, and tetanus. In the Philippines, timely vaccination is a challenge, with significant delays observed, highlighting the need for improved immunization systems, such as the proposed "Rural Health Unit Immunization Information System" that aims to streamline and digitize vaccination processes for better management and accessibility.

The main objective of this study is to develop Rural Health Unit Immunization Information System with Vaccination Demand Allocation, Forecasting and Scheduling.

   >Develop a registration module for the RHU Immunization.
    
   >Develop an immunization coverage forecasting system.
   
   >Develop an allocation module to avoid wastage of the vaccines.
   
   >Evaluate the system based on ISO 25010.

Each one of the objectives were successfully tackled, and given solutions
